# Quora Ad Removal extensions
**A web extension to remove Ads on Quora webpage**

## Details

I have made this extension for Chrome and Firefox. It works only the Quora websites and searches for Ad content and hides it, I have also enabled an option to toggle this action.

By default when web page is loaded the Ads are removed. so if you want to toggle you can use those button from popup.

**Note:** Remember This toggle action is not permanent, the deafault action of removing ads from Quora.com website remains active until the user disables the extension
